# Safe-JA
This project is currently being done along with a few colleagues from my Enterprise Applications Development class at the VTDI. Our project is an online platform where citizens, both security personnel and residents,  of Jamaica are able to log on and report crimes, track reports, see missing persons list, log evidence, view zones of special operations, etc.
